notes: 
Wrote up APIs for complex db execution like joins, join deletes, join updates
Cleaned up alot of spaghetti code
Reworked how refresh tokens work to now allow the front end user to hit a refresh API instead of being given an updated access token after each API hit
Refresh tokens are now stored in teh database for extra security
Talked to new front end intern and showed him the theme + walked him through the documentation
Went through requests with Maryan (still in progress)
Reorganized utility functions for modularity 
Wrote up API to enter permissions for assigning and modifying roles when the new roles are added
Changed how validation objects were loaded to be dynamic instead of static
Mapped table names to their counterpart models for fewer accesses to the database and instead access to the models themselves
