Defending a Node.js server against various types of attacks requires a multi-layered security approach. Below are defensive strategies for each of the previously listed attack vectors:

### 1. **Denial of Service (DoS)**

#### **HTTP Flooding**
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting using middleware like `express-rate-limit` to restrict the number of requests a client can make within a specific timeframe.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use services like Cloudflare or AWS WAF to filter and block malicious traffic before it reaches your server.
- **Traffic Monitoring:** Continuously monitor traffic patterns to identify and mitigate abnormal spikes.

#### **Slowloris Attack**
- **Timeout Settings:** Configure server timeouts to close connections that remain idle or incomplete for too long. For example, set `timeout` in the Node.js HTTP server.
- **Connection Limits:** Limit the number of simultaneous connections from a single IP address.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy to handle incoming connections more efficiently and mitigate Slowloris attacks.

#### **Application-Level DoS**
- **Optimize Code:** Ensure that your application code is efficient and avoids blocking operations. Use asynchronous programming practices to handle high concurrency.
- **Caching:** Implement caching strategies (e.g., using Redis or Memcached) to reduce the load on backend services and databases.
- **Resource Limits:** Set limits on resource-intensive operations and use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.

### 2. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**

#### **Botnet Attack**
- **CDN and DDoS Protection Services:** Utilize Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare, Akamai, or AWS CloudFront that offer built-in DDoS protection.
- **IP Blacklisting/Whitelisting:** Automatically blacklist suspicious IP addresses and whitelist trusted ones.
- **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Apply global rate limiting to prevent excessive requests from multiple sources.

### 3. **Injection Attacks**

#### **SQL Injection**
- **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized or prepared statements with your database queries to ensure that input is treated as data, not executable code.
- **ORMs:** Utilize Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) like Sequelize or TypeORM, which abstract SQL queries and reduce injection risks.
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs using libraries like `validator.js`.

#### **NoSQL Injection**
- **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize inputs to prevent injection of NoSQL operators. Use libraries like `mongo-sanitize` to remove prohibited characters.
- **Use ORM/ODM:** Use Object Data Mappers (ODMs) like Mongoose, which provide schema validation and help prevent injection.
- **Strict Schema Validation:** Enforce strict schemas for your NoSQL databases to ensure only expected data types and structures are accepted.

#### **Command Injection**
- **Avoid Direct Shell Access:** Refrain from using functions like `exec` or `spawn` with unsanitized inputs. If necessary, use safer alternatives like `child_process.execFile`.
- **Input Validation:** Strictly validate and sanitize all inputs that could be used in system commands.
- **Use Whitelists:** Allow only specific, known commands and arguments rather than accepting arbitrary input.

### 4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

#### **Stored XSS**
- **Output Encoding:** Encode data before rendering it in the browser using libraries like `helmet` or templating engines that automatically escape output.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

- **Avoid Echoing Unsanitized Input:** Do not directly reflect user inputs in responses without proper encoding or validation.

### 5. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **CSRF Tokens:** Use anti-CSRF tokens with each state-changing request. Libraries like `csurf` can help implement this in Express applications.
- **SameSite Cookies:** Set the `SameSite` attribute on cookies to `Strict` or `Lax` to prevent them from being sent with cross-origin requests.
- **Double Submit Cookies:** Use a technique where a token is sent both in a cookie and a request parameter and validated on the server.

### 6. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**

#### **Traffic Interception**
- **Use HTTPS:** Ensure all communications between clients and the server are encrypted using TLS/SSL certificates. Use tools like Let's Encrypt for free certificates.
